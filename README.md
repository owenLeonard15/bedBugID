# bedBugID
bed bug identification app

This is the front end portion of a mobile app which utilizes a machine learning model to identify bed bugs. The model is maintained separately so that it can be updated without the app itself being redeployed.

The back end portion of the app is also maintained separately in the following repo: https://github.com/owenLeonard15/BugsBuddyBack
